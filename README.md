# azImageRotatePatch

This is a WordPress plugin to fix the missing `imagerotate()` function in Ubuntu/PHP. The code seems to no longer publicly be available, so I'm offering it here. The comments credit it to [Activezero](http://www.activezero.co.uk/), but there are no details on that site as far as I can see. I've been using the plugin for some years, and it seems to work fine for me!

The plugin does not include a reference to a license, so I am assuming GNU GPL. However if you are risk averse, use another plugin.

There are other `imagerotate()` fix plugins on wordpress.org, but they didn't seem to do basic things, like check to see if the function is already defined.
